# **App Name**: RoboViz

## Core Features:

- DH Parameter Input: Allow users to input Denavit-Hartenberg parameters for a robotic arm. L_i as fixed length, q_i as dynamic parameter
- 3D Visualization: Render a 3D model of the robotic arm based on the DH parameters.
- Real-time Adjustment: Dynamically update the 3D model as DH parameters are adjusted.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to represent technology and precision.
- Background color: Light gray (#ECEFF1) for a clean, uncluttered interface.
- Accent color: Electric green (#7CFC00) to highlight interactive elements and adjustments.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern look, for a clean and readable interface.
- Use simple, geometric icons to represent different joints and parameters.
- Divide the screen into clear sections for parameter input, 3D visualization, and control panels.
- Use smooth transitions and animations when updating the 3D model based on parameter changes.
